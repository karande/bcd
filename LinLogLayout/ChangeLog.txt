2007-12-21:
- improved robustness of MinimizerBarnesHut for layouts with very small
  or very large distances (which often occur for unconnected graphs)
- added alternative layouter class MinimizerClassic, which is usually slower
  than MinimizerBarnesHut, but simpler and not limited to three dimensions
- the primary reference for the LinLog energy models is now the journal paper
  A. Noack: "Energy Models for Graph Clustering",  Journal of Graph Algorithms
  and Applications, Vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 453-480, 2007.  http://jgaa.info/

2008-01-14
- added clustering by maximizing Mark Newman's Modularity measure
- improved layouter classes MinimizerBarnesHut and MinimizerClassic
  * simplified interface
  * implementation using Java Collections Framework
  * replaced float with double
  * corrected movement of nodes in OctTree (MinimizerBarnesHut)
- added example Food.el

2008-01-21
- improved graph viewer
  * search for nodes
  * labels can be turned on and off
  * transparency for improved representation of overlapping nodes
  * all node names are listed when pointing at overlapping nodes

2008-03-21
- minor changes in OptimizerModularity
  * fixed bug for modularity clusterings with one cluster
  * optional code for randomized contraction (commented out)
- replaced example graph 8Clusters.el

2008-11-13
- minor changes in MinimizerBarnesHut and MinimizerClassic
  * improved gravitation, such that the same "gravitation factor" (gravFactor)
    should now work more consistently across different graphs and energy models;
    as a consequence, the value of the parameter gravFactor of the constructors
    may need to be adapted (values from 0.01 to 0.1 should mostly work well).
- minor changes in OptimizerModularity
  * removed option to optimize the "normalized cut"
  * changed console output to modularity, instead of negative modularity
  * added reference to new preprint "Modularity clustering is force-directed
    layout"
- added example graph Karate.el (Zachary's karate club) and example screenshots

2008-11-14
- changes in MinimizerBarnesHut and MinimizerClassic
  * removed restriction that attrExponent must be positive
  * another fix of the gravitation
- minor changes in the documentation
