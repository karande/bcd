Data Format:
Each line contains two members of a karate club and the number of contexts
(like university classes, bars, karate tournaments) in which they interacted.
(Pairs of members without interactions are omitted.)


Data Source: Figure 3 of:
Wayne W. Zachary. An information flow model for conflict and fission
in small groups. Journal of Anthropological Research, 33:452–473, 1977.


Notes:
- Although the matrix in Figure 3 should be symmetric, it contains a few
asymmetries; for example column 1 / row 13 is 1, while column 13 / row 1 is 2.
In these cases, the value from the entry with column < row was used.
(The asymmetric entries are 1/13, 3/33, 9/33, 9/34, 23/34, 24/30.)
- Some studies use the version with binary (0 or 1) edge weights from Figure 2 
of the article.
